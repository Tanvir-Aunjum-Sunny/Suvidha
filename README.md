Suvidha is an android app that my team made in a hackathon organised by IBM. We made it in 4 days. We used IBM Bluemix for the backend services. 

There are 3 main users for this application : Patient, Doctor and Hospital
  
The app provides the following features:
  Allows patients, doctors and hospitals to register in the app
  
  Use cases for patients : 
        Allows patients to search for doctors and hospitals near them or based on the ratings
        Allows patients to take appointments from doctors
        Allows patients to rate and leave a review for the doctors that they have visited
        Update his profile
        Allows a patient to avail the emergency service wherein the hospital nearest to the patients current location sends an ambulance over  
  
  Use cases for doctor :
        Allows a doctor to accept or reject an appointment
        See his own rating and reviews
        Update his profile
  
  Use cases for hospitals : 
        Allows a hospital to add doctors to its hospital
